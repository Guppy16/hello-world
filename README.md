## Cool Ideas

- DJI Tello Drone in Acro Mode
  - Seems like no one has coded it, but some ppl may wna try it
  - Not sure if it's feasible considering the drone's props are NOT screwed on and battery may not be suitable
  - Could try and get sponsored from [here](https://www.unmannedtech.co.uk/studentsresearchers.html)

- Nixie Clock
  - Purchase the kit w/o IN-14 tubes on [ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/184671627749)
  - Purchase the IN-14 tubes in [4](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/303748809541) / [6](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/274874326051) pack on ebay
  - PV Electronics Kit [Instructions](http://www.pvelectronics.co.uk/index.php?main_page=page_2)
  - Note that the kit on PV Electronics [site](https://www.pvelectronics.co.uk/index.php?products_id=244) is more expensive

- [DIY VR Haptic Gloves](https://hackaday.io/project/178243-lucidvr-budget-haptic-glove)
